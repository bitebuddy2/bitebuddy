The sweet prawns pair beautifully with the spicy curry paste and creamy coconut milk, while crisp vegetables add texture and freshness. Served over fluffy jasmine rice, it's a restaurant-quality dish that brings a taste of Thailand to your table in under 30 minutes.",

  "tips": [
    "Don't overcook the prawns - they cook very quickly and should be removed from heat as soon as they turn pink",
    "For the best flavour, use raw prawns rather than pre-cooked. Frozen raw prawns work perfectly if thawed properly",
    "Add cherry tomatoes for extra colour and a slight tang - they pair beautifully with prawns",
    "If you prefer a thicker curry sauce, simmer for a few extra minutes to reduce before adding the prawns",
    "Prawns release liquid as they cook, so don't worry if the curry seems slightly thinner after adding them",
    "For an extra special touch, serve with Thai sticky rice instead of jasmine rice"
  ],
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I use frozen prawns for this recipe?",
      "answer": "Yes, frozen prawns work perfectly! Make sure to fully thaw them first (overnight in the fridge is best), then pat them completely dry with kitchen paper before cooking. Excess moisture can make the curry watery and prevent the prawns from cooking properly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between prawns and shrimp?",
      "answer": "In the UK, we typically use the term 'prawns' for all sizes, while in the US they distinguish between shrimp (smaller) and prawns (larger). For this recipe, use large or king prawns for the best texture and flavour. The cooking time is the same regardless of what you call them!"
    },
    {
      "question": "My curry sauce split when I added the prawns - what happened?",
      "answer": "This usually happens if the heat is too high or the prawns weren't fully thawed and patted dry. The excess moisture and cold temperature can shock the coconut milk. To fix it, lower the heat and stir gently - the sauce should come back together. Next time, ensure prawns are room temperature and completely dry."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add other seafood to this curry?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! This curry works brilliantly with mixed seafood. Try adding squid rings, mussels, or chunks of firm white fish along with the prawns. Just remember that different seafood has different cooking times - add fish first (4-5 minutes), then prawns (3-4 minutes), and squid last (2 minutes) to prevent overcooking."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know when prawns are cooked?",
      "answer": "Perfectly cooked prawns will be pink/coral in colour, opaque (not translucent), and form a loose C-shape. If they're tightly curled into an O-shape, they're overcooked. They should feel just firm to the touch but still slightly springy, not tough or rubbery."
