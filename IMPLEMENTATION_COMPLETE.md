## 🔧 Next Steps - Apply Database Migrations

### Step 1: Apply Supabase Migrations

Run these SQL migrations in your Supabase SQL Editor in order:

```bash
# 1. Create comments table and storage
supabase/migrations/20250109000000_create_recipe_comments.sql

# 2. Update saved_ai_recipes table
supabase/migrations/20250109000001_update_saved_ai_recipes_for_publishing.sql
```

**Or run via CLI:**
```bash
npx supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Verify Bite Buddy Kitchen Brand in Sanity

1. Go to your Sanity Studio
2. Navigate to "Brand / Chain" documents
3. Ensure a brand with `slug = "bite-buddy-kitchen"` exists
4. If not, create it with:
   - **Title:** Bite Buddy Kitchen
   - **Slug:** bite-buddy-kitchen
   - **Logo:** Upload a chef hat or community icon
   - **Description:** "User-generated recipes created with AI assistance"
