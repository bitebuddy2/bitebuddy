    introText:
      "Costa's Ham and Cheese Topped Toastie is a coffee shop classic that takes the humble toastie to the next level. What makes Costa's version so special is the signature cheese topping - before the toastie goes in the press, they add grated cheese on top of the bread which melts and crisps into a golden, crunchy crust. This creates an amazing textural contrast: melted, gooey cheese inside and crispy, caramelized cheese on the outside. The filling is simple but perfect - quality ham, mature cheddar cheese, and a touch of mustard mayo that adds tangy creamness without overpowering the other flavours. Unlike many toasties that can be dry, Costa's version stays moist inside thanks to the mayo-mustard mixture, while the cheese topping ensures maximum crispy satisfaction. This copycat recipe recreates that signature topped style using a panini press or grill, though you can also use a frying pan with a weighted lid. The key is using thick-sliced bread that can hold up to the generous filling, and not skimping on the cheese topping - that's what makes it Costa! Perfect for a quick lunch, light dinner, or weekend brunch treat.",

      "Mix the mustard and mayo together before spreading - this ensures even distribution of flavor throughout the toastie.",
      "Don't overfill - too much filling will squeeze out during toasting. Costa uses about 50g ham and 30g cheese per toastie.",
      "If your panini press heats from above, the cheese topping will caramelize beautifully. If using a frying pan, some cheese may stick to the pan - these crispy bits are delicious!",
      "Add a slice of tomato inside for extra moisture and a fresh contrast (Costa sometimes offers this as an option).",
      "For extra Costa authenticity, use a mix of mature cheddar and Red Leicester for the topping - the orange cheese is part of their signature look.",
