    introText:
      "Wagamama's Pulled Shiitake Donburi is a triumph of plant-based cooking, proving that vegan food can be just as satisfying, flavourful, and exciting as any meat dish. This stunning rice bowl features shiitake mushrooms that have been 'pulled' apart to create meaty, tender strands, then glazed in a sweet-savoury sauce until sticky and caramelised. Paired with vibrant fresh vegetables, fluffy Japanese rice, and aromatic garnishes, it's become one of Wagamama's most popular vegan dishes since its introduction. What makes this dish so special is the treatment of the shiitake mushrooms - these umami-rich fungi have a naturally meaty texture that intensifies when cooked, and the pulling technique creates more surface area for the glaze to cling to. The sauce is a masterful balance of soy, mirin, maple syrup, and sesame oil, creating layers of sweet, salty, and nutty flavours that transform the mushrooms into something truly extraordinary. The contrast of textures is beautiful: tender pulled shiitake, crisp broccoli, crunchy cabbage, and soft edamame beans all sitting on a bed of warm sushi rice. Fresh spring onions, red chilli, and toasted sesame seeds add brightness and visual appeal. This recipe recreates Wagamama's version faithfully, using the same cooking techniques that make the restaurant dish so addictive. The key is taking time to properly pull the mushrooms and letting them caramelise in the glaze - don't rush this step! Making it at home means you can enjoy this vegan favourite whenever you like, adjust the vegetables to your preference, and save money compared to dining out. It's substantial enough to satisfy even the biggest appetites, and so delicious that even non-vegans will be impressed!",

Shiitake mushrooms in particular are prized in Japanese cooking for their depth of flavour and satisfying texture. Wagamama's modern interpretation combines these traditional ingredients with contemporary plant-based cooking techniques, creating a dish that's rooted in Japanese culinary heritage but feels completely current. The 'pulled' technique mimics the texture of pulled pork or jackfruit dishes, making it particularly appealing to those transitioning to plant-based eating or simply wanting to eat less meat without sacrificing satisfaction.",

      "Don't slice the mushrooms - pull them! This creates a more interesting, meaty texture with irregular pieces that hold the glaze better.",
      "Fresh shiitake are essential - dried shiitake that have been rehydrated won't have the right texture. Look for firm mushrooms with intact caps.",
      "The key to great flavour is letting the mushrooms caramelise properly in the glaze. Keep the heat high and let them get sticky and dark.",
      "Toast your sesame seeds in a dry pan for 2-3 minutes until golden - it intensifies their nutty flavour significantly.",
      "For extra protein, add crispy tofu cubes: press and cube firm tofu, then pan-fry until golden before adding to the bowl.",
      "Make it gluten-free by using tamari instead of regular soy sauce - the rest of the dish is naturally gluten-free.",
      "Substitute agave syrup or brown rice syrup for maple syrup if needed - both work well in the glaze.",
      "Add extra vegetables like pak choi, sugar snap peas, or baby corn to bulk it up even more.",

        answer:
          "Shiitake are really the best choice for their meaty texture and umami flavour, but in a pinch, you could use king oyster mushrooms (which also shred well), portobello mushrooms, or even large chestnut mushrooms. Avoid button mushrooms as they're too watery and small. Whatever you use, make sure to tear or shred them to create that pulled texture.",

        answer:
          "Yes, with some caveats! Cook the rice and prepare the glazed mushrooms up to 2 days ahead and store separately in the fridge. Blanch the broccoli and keep it refrigerated. When ready to eat, reheat the mushrooms and broccoli gently (microwave or pan), warm the rice, then assemble fresh. Don't assemble too far in advance or the rice will absorb moisture and become mushy. Add fresh garnishes just before serving.",

        question: "Why are my mushrooms watery instead of sticky?",
        answer:
          "Two common causes: 1) The pan wasn't hot enough, causing the mushrooms to steam rather than caramelise - make sure your pan is properly hot before adding them, or 2) You added the glaze too early before the mushrooms had a chance to brown and lose their moisture. Cook the mushrooms first until golden, THEN add the glaze and let it reduce until thick and sticky.",
