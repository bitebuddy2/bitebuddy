    introText:
      "Wagamama's Grilled Duck Donburi is one of their most celebrated dishes - a beautiful Japanese rice bowl featuring perfectly cooked duck breast glazed with a sweet-savoury sauce, served over steaming sushi rice with crisp vegetables and aromatic garnishes. Donburi, meaning 'rice bowl' in Japanese, is a cornerstone of Japanese cuisine, and Wagamama's interpretation showcases their skill in balancing authentic Japanese techniques with bold, contemporary flavours. What makes this dish so special is the duck itself - scored and pan-fried to render the fat, creating irresistibly crispy skin while keeping the meat tender and pink. The glaze is a masterpiece of umami, combining soy sauce, mirin, sake, honey, and five-spice powder to create layers of sweet, salty, and subtly spiced flavour that complements the rich duck perfectly. The contrast of textures is key: crispy duck skin against tender meat, crunchy vegetables against soft rice, all brought together with fresh spring onions, red chilli, and toasted sesame seeds. This recipe captures everything that makes Wagamama's version so popular - the careful scoring technique that ensures crispy skin, the perfectly balanced glaze that's neither too sweet nor too salty, and the assembly method that creates a beautiful, Instagram-worthy presentation. Making it at home means you can enjoy this restaurant favourite any night of the week, adjust the spice level to your preference, and save significantly compared to dining out. While duck breast might seem intimidating, this recipe breaks down every step clearly, and the impressive results will make you look like a professional chef!",

With their signature long communal benches, open kitchens, and 'positive eating + positive living' philosophy, Wagamama revolutionised casual Asian dining in the UK and has since expanded to over 200 locations worldwide.",

The dish showcases their commitment to quality ingredients and proper cooking techniques, with each duck breast cooked to order rather than pre-cooked and reheated. It's become a favourite among regulars who appreciate the richness of duck paired with the freshness of vegetables and the comforting base of perfectly cooked Japanese rice.",

    tips: [
      "Don't skip the scoring! Properly scored duck skin renders fat better and becomes incredibly crispy - the signature of this dish.",
      "Starting duck in a cold pan is crucial. This gentle heating allows the fat to render slowly without burning the skin.",
      "Use a meat thermometer for perfect doneness: 52-55¬∞C for medium-rare (recommended for duck), 58-60¬∞C for medium.",
      "If you can't find sake, use dry sherry or Chinese rice wine (Shaoxing wine) as a substitute.",
      "Toast your sesame seeds for 2-3 minutes in a dry pan until golden and fragrant - it makes a huge difference to the flavour.",
      "Save the rendered duck fat! Store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks and use it for the best roast potatoes you've ever made.",
      "For authentic Wagamama presentation, use a vegetable peeler to create cucumber ribbons rather than slicing into chunks.",
      "Make it spicier by adding more fresh red chilli or a drizzle of chilli oil (rayu) at the end - delicious!",

        question: "How do I cook perfect sushi rice?",
        answer:
          "Rinse 150g uncooked sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear (this removes excess starch). Add to a pan with 200ml water, bring to the boil, then reduce to low, cover, and simmer for 12 minutes. Remove from heat and let steam, covered, for 10 minutes. Season with a splash of rice wine vinegar and a pinch of sugar if desired. Fluff with a fork before serving.",

        question: "Can I use chicken instead of duck?",
        answer:
          "Yes! Use 2 boneless, skin-on chicken thighs or breasts. Score the skin the same way and cook skin-side down for 6-8 minutes, then flip and cook for another 6-8 minutes until cooked through (internal temperature 75¬∞C). Glaze in the last 2 minutes as per the recipe. The flavour will be milder than duck but still delicious.",

        question: "My duck skin isn't crispy - what did I do wrong?",
        answer:
          "Three common issues: 1) The duck breasts weren't dry enough before cooking (pat them very dry), 2) You started in a hot pan instead of cold (this burns the skin before the fat renders), or 3) You moved them around too much (leave them untouched to crisp up). Also ensure you're pouring off excess fat as it accumulates.",

        question: "Is this dish gluten-free?",
        answer:
          "No, regular soy sauce contains gluten. However, you can easily make it gluten-free by using tamari (gluten-free soy sauce) instead of regular soy sauce, and ensuring your other ingredients are gluten-free. The rest of the dish is naturally gluten-free. Check the brand's website or ask in restaurants as Wagamama does offer gluten-free options.",

          "Yes! Cook the rice up to 2 hours ahead and keep warm, covered. Make the glaze sauce up to 3 days ahead and refrigerate. Prep all vegetables and store covered in the fridge. Score and season the duck up to 4 hours ahead and refrigerate (bring to room temperature before cooking). However, cook the duck fresh for best results - it only takes 15 minutes!",
