    introText:
      "Greggs Vegan Sausage Roll became a cultural phenomenon when it launched in January 2019, selling out across the UK within weeks and sparking a plant-based revolution on the British high street. What made this vegan sausage roll so special wasn't just that it was plant-based - it was that it tasted incredible, with many people (including meat-eaters) preferring it to the original. The secret lies in the perfectly seasoned soya-based filling that mimics the texture and flavour of traditional sausage meat, wrapped in Greggs' signature flaky puff pastry that shatters with every bite. The filling is packed with herbs, spices, and umami-rich flavours that create depth and satisfaction, proving that vegan food can be just as indulgent and delicious as anything else. This copycat recipe recreates that exact taste and texture using simple, accessible ingredients - soya mince seasoned with sage, thyme, and smoked paprika, all wrapped in golden puff pastry. Whether you're vegan, trying to eat more plant-based meals, or just love a good sausage roll, this homemade version delivers authentic Greggs taste at a fraction of the cost. Perfect for lunch, picnics, or party food!",

    tips: [
      "Make sure the filling is completely cool before assembling - hot filling will make the pastry soggy and difficult to work with.",
      "Jus-Rol puff pastry is accidentally vegan in the UK and works perfectly for this recipe. Always check the label as some brands contain butter.",
      "The breadcrumbs are essential - they absorb moisture and give the filling that firm, sausage-like texture that holds together when you bite into it.",
      "Make ahead: assemble the rolls, freeze them unbaked, then bake from frozen adding 5-10 minutes extra time. Perfect for batch cooking!",
      "Sage is the key herb that makes it taste like traditional sausage - don't skip it! The combination with thyme creates that authentic flavor.",
      "For extra Greggs authenticity, make them slightly smaller (8 rolls instead of 6) - Greggs portions are generous but not huge.",
      "Serve with tomato ketchup or brown sauce for the full British experience!",

        question: "What can I use instead of soya mince?",
        answer:
          "You can use Quorn mince (Greggs uses Quorn), lentils cooked until very soft and mashed, or finely chopped mushrooms mixed with walnuts. The texture will differ slightly but all work well. If using Quorn, skip the rehydration step as it's already moist.",

        question: "How do I know if my puff pastry is vegan?",
        answer:
          "Check the ingredients list - avoid anything with butter, milk, or eggs. In the UK, Jus-Rol puff pastry (the ready-rolled sheets) is vegan. Most supermarket own-brand frozen puff pastry is also vegan, but always check. It should list vegetable oil or margarine, not butter.",

        question: "Can I make these gluten-free?",
        answer:
          "Yes! Use gluten-free puff pastry (available in most supermarkets), gluten-free breadcrumbs, and check your stock cube is gluten-free. The soya mince is naturally gluten-free. The texture will be slightly different but still delicious.",

        question: "How long do they keep and how should I store them?",
        answer:
          "Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven at 180¬∞C for 10 minutes to restore crispiness. They also freeze brilliantly - freeze unbaked for up to 3 months, or baked for up to 1 month. Bake from frozen, adding 5-10 minutes.",

        question: "Why is my filling too wet or too dry?",
        answer:
          "If too wet, add more breadcrumbs (1 tbsp at a time) and cook for longer to evaporate moisture. If too dry, add a splash of vegetable stock or water. The mixture should be moist but hold together when shaped - similar to sausage meat consistency.",
