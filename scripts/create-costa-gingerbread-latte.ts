      "Costa's Gingerbread Latte is the ultimate festive coffee drink, arriving on the menu each November to signal the start of the Christmas season. This seasonal favourite combines the warmth of traditional gingerbread spices - ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves - with rich espresso and velvety steamed milk, creating a drink that tastes like Christmas in liquid form. What makes Costa's version so special is the homemade-style gingerbread syrup that captures the exact flavour of freshly baked gingerbread biscuits, with a perfect balance of spice and sweetness that doesn't overpower the coffee. Topped with whipped cream and often garnished with a mini gingerbread biscuit, it's become one of the most anticipated drinks of the year. This copycat recipe shows you how to make the authentic gingerbread syrup at home using pantry spices and simple ingredients, then combine it with coffee and milk to recreate that exact Costa taste. Whether you're craving festive flavours in October or want to enjoy gingerbread lattes all year round without the caf√© price tag, this recipe delivers the real deal in just 15 minutes!",

        question: "Can I use ground ginger from a jar or does it have to be fresh?",
        answer:
          "You must use ground (powdered) ginger, not fresh ginger root. Fresh ginger won't dissolve in the syrup and will create a completely different flavour. Ground ginger from a jar is perfect and what gives the authentic gingerbread taste. Make sure it's relatively fresh for the best flavour.",

        question: "How much gingerbread syrup should I use per latte?",
        answer:
          "Start with 2 tablespoons and taste - you can always add more. Costa's version is quite sweet, so 2-3 tablespoons is typical. The beauty of homemade is you can adjust to your preference. The syrup is concentrated, so a little goes a long way.",

        question: "Can I make this without golden syrup?",
        answer:
          "Yes, but golden syrup adds a lovely caramel depth. Substitute with honey, maple syrup, or an extra 2 tbsp of brown sugar plus 1 tbsp of water. The flavour will be slightly different but still delicious. Honey makes it more floral, maple adds earthiness.",

        question: "How do I store leftover gingerbread syrup?",
        answer:
          "Store in a clean, airtight jar or bottle in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. The syrup will thicken when cold - warm it slightly before use or just stir it vigorously into hot coffee. You can also freeze it in ice cube trays for up to 3 months.",

        answer:
          "A latte has more milk and less foam (about 1/3 espresso, 2/3 steamed milk, thin foam layer). A cappuccino is equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and thick foam. For a gingerbread cappuccino, use the same syrup recipe but with 180ml milk and create a thick foam layer on top.",
