    introText:
      "Wagamama's Shu's 'Shiok' Chicken is a celebration of bold, aromatic Malaysian flavours, bringing together tender chicken, thick udon noodles, and fresh vegetables in a fragrant, creamy coconut curry broth. The name 'shiok' is a Singlish (Singaporean-Malaysian English) word meaning 'extremely good' or 'awesome', and this dish absolutely lives up to its name. Created as part of Wagamama's exploration of Southeast Asian cuisine, it showcases the restaurant's skill in adapting traditional flavours for British palates while maintaining authentic taste profiles. What makes this dish so addictive is the masterful balance of flavours in the broth - creamy coconut milk tempered with the heat of red curry paste, the citrus punch of lemongrass and lime leaves, the umami depth of fish sauce, and the brightness of lime juice. The curry paste provides warmth without overwhelming heat, making it accessible yet exciting. The chicken thighs are cut into bite-sized pieces and cooked until tender, absorbing all those wonderful flavours while staying juicy. Thick, chewy udon noodles provide substance and soak up the fragrant broth beautifully. Fresh vegetables add colour, crunch, and nutrition - vibrant red peppers, crisp mangetout, and tender pak choi all contribute different textures and tastes. This recipe captures everything that makes Wagamama's version so popular, using the same aromatics and cooking techniques that create layers of complex flavour. Making it at home means you can adjust the spice level to your preference, load it up with extra vegetables if you like, and enjoy this restaurant favourite any night of the week at a fraction of the cost!",

It's particularly popular during colder months when customers crave warming, spicy broths, though its fans order it year-round. The use of udon noodles instead of traditional rice noodles is a clever Wagamama touch, offering more substantial texture while nodding to their Japanese heritage.",

    tips: [
      "Fresh lemongrass and lime leaves make a huge difference to authenticity - most Asian supermarkets stock them, and lime leaves freeze beautifully.",
      "Use full-fat coconut milk, not light - you need the richness and body. Shake the tin well before opening to emulsify the cream and liquid.",
      "Thai red curry paste varies in heat between brands. Mae Ploy and Blue Dragon are common UK brands - start with 2 tbsp and add more if you like it spicier.",
      "Chicken thighs stay much juicier than breast in this dish and have better flavour, but breast works if you prefer (just don't overcook it).",
      "Don't skip the lime juice at the end - it's essential for balancing the richness of the coconut milk and bringing all the flavours together.",
      "For a pescatarian version, swap chicken for prawns - add them in the last 3-4 minutes of cooking so they don't become rubbery.",
      "Make it vegetarian/vegan by using tofu instead of chicken and soy sauce instead of fish sauce.",
      "Add extra vegetables like baby corn, mushrooms, or bean sprouts for more bulk and nutrition.",

        question: "How spicy is this dish?",
        answer:
          "Wagamama's version is medium-mild - flavourful and aromatic with gentle warmth rather than blow-your-head-off heat. The curry paste provides depth and complexity without overwhelming spice. If you're sensitive to heat, start with 1.5 tbsp curry paste. For spice lovers, use 3 tbsp or add extra fresh chilli. You can always add more heat but can't take it away!",

        question: "Can I use a different type of noodle?",
        answer:
          "Udon noodles are ideal for their thick, chewy texture that stands up to the rich broth, but you can substitute with rice noodles (more traditional for Southeast Asian curries), ramen noodles, or even egg noodles. Cooking times will vary - follow packet instructions. Fresh udon from the chilled section are best if you can find them.",

        _type: "object",
        question: "What can I use if I can't find lime leaves?",
        answer:
          "Fresh lime leaves are best (check Asian supermarkets or buy frozen online), but if you absolutely can't find them, add extra lemongrass and the zest of 1 lime to the broth (add zest in step 3, remove before serving). The flavour won't be identical but will still be delicious and fragrant. Don't use dried lime powder - it's not the same thing.",

        question: "Can I make the broth in advance?",
        answer:
          "Yes! Make the curry broth up to 2 days ahead and store in the fridge. The flavours actually improve overnight as they meld together. Reheat gently, then add the chicken and vegetables and proceed from step 5. Cook the noodles fresh just before serving for best texture. The broth also freezes well for up to 3 months.",

        question: "My coconut milk split/looks grainy - what happened?",
        answer:
          "This happens when coconut milk is boiled too vigorously or cooked on too high heat. Keep it at a gentle simmer rather than a rolling boil. If it does split, whisk it vigorously or blend a portion of the broth with a stick blender to re-emulsify it. Using full-fat coconut milk (not light) and not over-stirring also helps prevent splitting.",
