      "The Big Mac is arguably the world's most famous burger, and for good reason. Since its creation in 1967 by Jim Delligatti, a McDonald's franchise owner in Pennsylvania, this iconic sandwich has become a cultural phenomenon. What makes it truly special isn't just the ingredients - it's the architecture. The genius three-layer construction with that middle 'club' bun creates the perfect bite every time. The legendary Big Mac sauce, a closely guarded secret for decades, combines tangy, sweet, and savory notes that make this burger absolutely unforgettable. This homemade version captures every detail of the original, from the perfectly seasoned beef patties to that distinctive sauce. You'll be amazed at how close you can get to the real thing in your own kitchen, and even better - you can customize it to your exact preferences!",

      "The Big Mac sauce can be made up to 3 days ahead and stored in an airtight container in the fridge. The flavour actually improves over time!",
      "For the most authentic experience, use 80/20 beef mince (20% fat). The fat content is crucial for juicy, flavourful patties.",
      "Don't skip toasting the buns - it's essential for preventing the burger from getting soggy from the sauce.",
      "To make perfect thin patties, place a ball of mince between two sheets of parchment paper and press firmly with a flat-bottomed pan.",
      "If you can't find burger bun heels for the middle layer, simply buy extra buns and use the bottom halves.",
      "For a healthier version, use turkey mince instead of beef and light mayonnaise in the sauce. You can also add extra lettuce for more crunch.",
      "Freeze extra Big Mac sauce in ice cube trays - each cube is about 1 tbsp, perfect for portioning!",

        question: "What makes Big Mac sauce different from Thousand Island dressing?",
        answer:
          "While similar, Big Mac sauce is tangier and less sweet than Thousand Island. It has more mustard and uses sweet pickle relish instead of ketchup, giving it that distinctive McDonald's taste. The addition of paprika and specific ratios of ingredients create the unique flavour profile.",

        question: "Can I make Big Macs ahead of time?",
        answer:
          "It's best to assemble Big Macs fresh, but you can prepare components ahead. Make the sauce up to 3 days early, cook and store patties for up to 2 days (reheat before assembling), and prep vegetables the night before. Assemble just before serving for the best texture.",

        question: "How do I get the beef patties as thin as McDonald's?",
        answer:
          "McDonald's uses special presses, but at home you can achieve similar results by pressing balls of mince (about 50g each) on a hot griddle with a spatula or flat-bottomed pan. Press firmly for 10-15 seconds. They should be about 3-4mm thick when cooked.",

        question: "What can I substitute for American cheese?",
        answer:
          "American cheese is ideal because it melts perfectly, but you can use mild cheddar, Monterey Jack, or even cheese slices. Just note that the melting properties and flavour will differ slightly from the authentic Big Mac experience.",

        question: "Can I make a vegetarian Big Mac?",
        answer:
          "Absolutely! Use plant-based burger patties (like Beyond or Impossible meat), vegan cheese slices, and vegan mayonnaise in the sauce. The assembly and all other ingredients remain the same. Many people find the vegetarian version just as satisfying!",
