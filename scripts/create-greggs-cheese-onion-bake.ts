    introText:
      "Greggs' Cheese and Onion Bake is one of Britain's most beloved bakery items, a golden rectangle of flaky puff pastry hiding a generous filling of rich melted cheese and sweet, softened onions. Since its introduction to Greggs shops across the UK, this vegetarian savoury has become a lunchtime staple for millions, offering serious comfort food satisfaction whether enjoyed hot from the oven or at room temperature. What makes the Cheese and Onion Bake so special is the contrast between the crisp, buttery pastry exterior and the soft, flavourful filling - sharp mature cheddar provides richness while caramelised onions add a subtle sweetness that perfectly balances the dish. Many fans consider it superior to Greggs' other savoury pastries, and it's consistently one of their best-sellers. This homemade version captures that classic Greggs taste and texture using simple ingredients you can find in any supermarket. The secret lies in cooking the onions until they're properly softened and sweet, creating a thick, creamy cheese sauce that won't leak out during baking, and getting that characteristic golden-brown finish on the pastry. Making them at home means you can enjoy them fresh from your own oven, customise the cheese-to-onion ratio to your preference, and save money compared to buying from the high street. Perfect for lunch boxes, picnics, or a satisfying snack any time of day!",

They're delicious warm or at room temperature, just like Greggs serve them. Perfect on their own or with a simple side salad.

    tips: [
      "Cold pastry is key - if it gets too warm, pop it back in the fridge for 10 minutes. Warm pastry becomes sticky and difficult to work with, and won't puff up as well.",
      "Don't overfill - too much filling will leak out during baking. Use about 3-4 tablespoons of filling per bake, leaving generous borders.",
      "Ensure the filling is completely cool before assembling, or it will melt the pastry and create a soggy base.",
      "For extra Greggs authenticity, use mature or extra-mature cheddar for a stronger cheese flavour that stands up to the sweet onions.",
      "If you prefer softer, sweeter onions (like in Greggs' version), cook them low and slow for 15-20 minutes until they're deeply caramelised.",
      "Freeze unbaked bakes on a tray until solid, then transfer to freezer bags. Bake from frozen, adding 5-10 minutes to the cooking time.",
      "The mustard is subtle but important - it adds depth and cuts through the richness. Don't skip it!",

        question: "Can I use shop-bought cheese sauce instead of making my own?",
        answer:
          "While you technically could, homemade sauce is much better and takes only 5 minutes. Shop-bought cheese sauces tend to be thinner and can make the pastry soggy. The thick, homemade b√©chamel-based sauce is crucial for authentic Greggs texture - it should be almost spreadable when cool, not runny.",

        question: "Can I make these in advance?",
        answer:
          "Yes! Assemble the bakes completely, then either refrigerate for up to 24 hours before baking (brush with egg just before baking), or freeze them unbaked. Frozen bakes can go straight into the oven from frozen - just add 5-10 minutes to the cooking time. They're perfect for batch cooking and meal prep.",

        question: "What's the best way to reheat them?",
        answer:
          "Always use the oven, never the microwave (which makes pastry soggy). Preheat oven to 180¬∞C, place the bakes on a baking tray, and heat for 8-10 minutes until hot through and the pastry is crispy again. You can cover loosely with foil if the tops are browning too much.",

        question: "Can I add other ingredients to the filling?",
        answer:
          "Absolutely! Popular additions include chopped spring onions, a handful of chopped spinach or kale (cooked and squeezed dry), crumbled bacon for a non-vegetarian version, or different cheeses like Red Leicester or Double Gloucester. Just ensure any additions are cooked and well-drained to avoid excess moisture.",

        question: "Why did my filling leak out?",
        answer:
          "This usually happens if: 1) The filling was too hot when you assembled them (always let it cool completely), 2) You overfilled them (less is more!), 3) The edges weren't sealed properly (press firmly and crimp with a fork), or 4) You forgot to make steam holes in the top. Following these tips will prevent leaking.",
