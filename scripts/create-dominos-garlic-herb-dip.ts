      "Domino's Garlic and Herb Dip is arguably the most famous pizza dip in the UK, with millions of pots sold every year alongside their pizzas. This creamy, garlicky sauce has achieved cult status, with fans claiming that Domino's pizza isn't complete without it.

The beauty of Domino's dip lies in its simplicity - it's not complicated, but the combination of fresh and dried herbs with quality mayo and soured cream creates something truly special. This homemade version captures that exact taste using easily available ingredients, and you can make it in just 5 minutes with no cooking required. Whether you're having a pizza night, need a quick dip for breadsticks, or just want that authentic Domino's experience at home, this recipe delivers the real deal. Once you try it, you'll never order the shop-bought version again!",
