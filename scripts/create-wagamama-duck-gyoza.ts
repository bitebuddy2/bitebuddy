    introText:
      "Wagamama's Duck Gyoza are one of the restaurant's most beloved starters - golden, crispy-bottomed dumplings filled with succulent duck mince, earthy shiitake mushrooms, and aromatic ginger and garlic. Gyoza, the Japanese take on Chinese potstickers, are a perfect balance of textures: crispy and caramelised on the bottom, soft and pillowy on top, with a juicy, flavourful filling inside. What makes Wagamama's version so special is the richness of the duck, which adds a deeper, more luxurious flavour compared to traditional pork gyoza. The filling is carefully seasoned with soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, and spring onions, creating an umami-packed bite that's both satisfying and moreish. The cooking technique is key - pan-frying followed by steaming creates that signature contrast between crispy base and tender top. While folding gyoza might seem intimidating, this recipe includes clear instructions for achieving those beautiful pleats, and even if yours aren't perfect, they'll still taste incredible! These gyoza are perfect as a starter for 4 people or as a light meal for 2, served with a simple dipping sauce of soy, rice vinegar, and chilli oil. Making them at home is not only more economical than ordering takeaway, but it's also a fun cooking project that's deeply satisfying when you bite into your first homemade dumpling. Plus, you can freeze any uncooked gyoza for quick, restaurant-quality meals whenever the craving strikes!",

Their duck gyoza reflect the restaurant's philosophy of taking classic dishes and making them exciting and contemporary. The crispy-bottomed cooking method, known as 'yaki-gyoza' in Japanese, is the most popular way to serve these dumplings in Japan, and Wagamama has perfected this technique to create the irresistible golden crust that keeps customers coming back.",

      "Don't overfill the gyoza! About 1 heaped teaspoon of filling is perfect - too much and they'll burst during cooking.",
      "Keep the uncooked gyoza covered with a damp tea towel while you work to prevent the wrappers from drying out.",
      "If you can't find duck mince, ask your butcher to mince duck breast for you, or use a food processor to pulse duck breast until minced.",
      "You can substitute pork, chicken, or turkey mince if duck is unavailable - the technique remains the same.",
      "Freeze uncooked gyoza on a tray until solid, then transfer to a freezer bag. Cook from frozen, adding 2-3 minutes to the steaming time.",
      "For vegetarian gyoza, replace duck with finely chopped firm tofu (squeezed dry) and increase the mushrooms and cabbage.",
      "The pleating isn't just for looks - it helps seal the gyoza and prevents filling from escaping. Practice makes perfect!",

        question: "Can I steam these instead of pan-frying?",
        answer:
          "Yes! You can steam the gyoza in a bamboo steamer lined with parchment paper (with holes poked through) or cabbage leaves for 8-10 minutes until cooked through. They won't have the crispy bottom, but they'll still be delicious and lighter. This method is called 'sui-gyoza' in Japanese.",

        answer:
          "Gyoza wrappers are available in the freezer section of most large supermarkets (look near the Asian ingredients), in Asian supermarkets, or online. They're also called 'dumpling wrappers' or 'wonton wrappers' - make sure to get the round ones, not square. They freeze well so buy extra!",

        question: "My gyoza keep bursting - what am I doing wrong?",
        answer:
          "Common causes: 1) Overfilling - use less filling (about 1 teaspoon), 2) Not sealing properly - ensure the edges are moist and pressed firmly together, 3) Too much water in the filling - squeeze the cabbage very well, 4) Old or dry wrappers - keep them covered and moist while working.",

        question: "Can I make these ahead of time?",
        answer:
          "Yes! Assemble the gyoza up to 4 hours ahead, arrange on a floured tray in a single layer (not touching), cover with cling film, and refrigerate. Alternatively, freeze them for up to 3 months. Frozen gyoza can be cooked directly from frozen - just add an extra 2-3 minutes to the steaming time.",

        answer:
          "Gyoza are the Japanese version of Chinese potstickers (jiaozi). They typically have thinner wrappers than Chinese dumplings, contain more garlic and ginger, and are traditionally cooked using the pan-fry-then-steam method. The thinner wrapper creates a more delicate texture and allows the filling flavours to shine through.",
