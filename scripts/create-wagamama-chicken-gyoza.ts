    introText:
      "Wagamama's Chicken Gyoza are the quintessential introduction to Japanese dumplings - light, delicate, and perfectly balanced, they've been a menu staple since the restaurant opened its doors in 1992. These dumplings showcase the purity of Japanese cooking: simple, high-quality ingredients prepared with precision to create something far greater than the sum of its parts. The filling is made with tender chicken mince, fresh cabbage, aromatic ginger and garlic, and a touch of mirin for subtle sweetness, all wrapped in thin, translucent gyoza skins. What makes these gyoza so beloved is their gentle, approachable flavour - not too rich, not too spicy, just perfectly seasoned with that classic umami depth from soy sauce and sesame oil. The technique is traditional Japanese yaki-gyoza: pan-fried until the bottoms turn golden and crispy, then steamed until the tops become soft and tender. This two-stage cooking creates the signature textural contrast that makes gyoza so irresistible - you get that satisfying crunch followed by a pillowy, juicy bite. These chicken gyoza are lighter than pork versions and less rich than duck, making them perfect as a starter for 4 people or as a satisfying light meal for 2. They're also incredibly versatile - serve them with classic soy-vinegar dipping sauce, pair them with ramen, or enjoy them on their own. Making gyoza at home might seem daunting, but once you get into the rhythm of filling and pleating, it becomes meditative and genuinely fun. Plus, you can freeze batches for quick weeknight meals that taste restaurant-quality in under 15 minutes!",

Fry for 2-3 minutes without moving them until the bottoms are golden brown and crispy. Carefully add 100ml of water to the pan (stand back - it will sizzle dramatically!), immediately cover tightly with a lid, and steam for 6-7 minutes. The water will evaporate and the wrappers will turn translucent when fully cooked. Remove the lid and cook for another 1-2 minutes to re-crisp the bottoms. Transfer to a serving plate, crispy-side up. Wipe the pan clean and repeat with the remaining gyoza.",

    tips: [
      "Don't use extra-lean chicken mince - a little fat (around 10-15%) keeps the filling juicy and flavourful.",
      "Work quickly when filling to prevent wrappers from drying out. Cover assembled gyoza with a damp cloth while you work.",
      "If you're new to pleating, watch a quick YouTube video - it's easier than it looks! Even if yours aren't perfect, they'll still taste amazing.",
      "For perfectly crispy bottoms, don't overcrowd the pan - gyoza need space for the bottoms to make contact with the hot surface.",
      "These freeze brilliantly! Freeze uncooked on a tray, then bag up. Cook from frozen, adding 2-3 minutes to the steaming time.",
      "Can't find mirin? Substitute with 1 tbsp white wine + 1/2 tsp sugar, or just use a little extra soy sauce.",
      "Make it a complete meal by serving with steamed rice, edamame, and a simple cucumber salad.",

        question: "Can I use chicken thighs instead of mince?",
        answer:
          "Absolutely! In fact, chicken thigh meat makes even juicier gyoza as it has more fat than breast meat. Finely chop boneless, skinless chicken thighs (or pulse in a food processor until minced but not paste-like) and use the exact same quantities. Some argue this method produces superior results!",

        answer:
          "Gyoza wrappers are widely available in the freezer section of large supermarkets (Tesco, Sainsbury's, Waitrose) near the Asian ingredients, in any Asian supermarket, or online. Look for round wrappers labelled 'gyoza wrappers' or 'dumpling wrappers' - not the square wonton wrappers. They keep for months in the freezer.",

        answer:
          "Common issues: 1) Too much water in the filling - squeeze that cabbage really well! 2) Overfilling - use only 1 teaspoon of filling per wrapper. 3) Not sealing properly - ensure the edges are moist and pressed firmly together. 4) Moving them too much during the initial frying - let them sit undisturbed to develop a crust.",

        question: "Can these be made gluten-free?",
        answer:
          "Yes! You'll need to use gluten-free gyoza wrappers (available online from specialist Asian stores) and substitute tamari for the soy sauce. Tamari is naturally gluten-free and tastes very similar to regular soy sauce. Check all other ingredients as some brands of mirin may contain gluten.",

        answer:
          "Use a good non-stick pan and ensure it's properly heated before adding the gyoza. Add enough oil (don't skimp!) and make sure the gyoza have flat bottoms so they sit flush with the pan. Once they're golden, they'll release easily. If using a regular pan, you may need slightly more oil.",
