      "The KFC Zinger Burger is a global phenomenon that's become one of the most requested items on KFC's menu worldwide. First introduced in Trinidad and Tobago in 1984, this spicy sensation quickly spread across the world, earning a cult following for its perfectly balanced heat and incredible crunch. What sets the Zinger apart is its double-coated, extra-crispy chicken fillet that's been marinated in buttermilk and packed with a secret blend of herbs and spices - including a serious kick of cayenne pepper. The combination of the fiery, crunchy chicken with cool, creamy mayo and crisp lettuce creates an addictive flavour experience that keeps fans coming back. This homemade version captures every element of the original, from the tongue-tingling spice level to that signature KFC crunch. Whether you're a spice lover or just want to recreate this iconic fast-food favourite, this recipe delivers authentic Zinger taste without the queue!",

    tips: [
      "For extra heat that matches the spiciest Zinger versions, increase the cayenne pepper to 3 tbsp and add 1/2 tsp of chilli powder to the coating.",
      "The marinade is key - don't skip it! Overnight marinating gives the most tender, flavourful results. In a pinch, marinate for at least 2 hours minimum.",
      "If you don't have buttermilk, make your own by adding 1 tbsp lemon juice or white vinegar to 300ml whole milk. Let it sit for 10 minutes until it curdles slightly.",
      "For a healthier version, bake the coated chicken at 220¬∞C (425¬∞F) for 25-30 minutes, turning halfway through and spraying with oil for crispiness.",
      "Keep the oil temperature consistent - too hot and the coating burns before the chicken cooks; too cool and you'll get greasy chicken.",
      "Make it a Zinger Tower by adding a hash brown and cheese slice between the chicken and top bun!",
      "Freeze leftover spiced flour mixture for up to 3 months - perfect for making quick Zingers or coating other proteins.",

        question: "How spicy is the KFC Zinger Burger?",
        answer:
          "The Zinger has a medium-hot spice level with a nice kick from the cayenne pepper. It's definitely spicier than a regular fried chicken burger but not overwhelming. You can adjust the cayenne in the coating to make it milder (1 tbsp) or hotter (3 tbsp) to suit your taste.",

          "Yes! Spray the coated chicken fillets generously with oil spray and air fry at 200¬∞C (400¬∞F) for 15-18 minutes, turning halfway through. The texture won't be quite as crispy as deep-fried but it's still delicious and much healthier.",

        question: "What type of bun should I use?",
        answer:
          "KFC uses long, soft white buns similar to sub rolls or brioche hot dog buns. Look for buns that are about 15-18cm long and soft but sturdy enough to hold the chicken and toppings. Brioche buns work particularly well as they're soft and slightly sweet.",

        answer:
          "You can marinate the chicken up to 24 hours ahead and store it in the fridge. The coated (but unfried) chicken can be prepared up to 2 hours ahead and kept in the fridge. For best results, fry just before serving. Leftover fried chicken can be reheated in the oven at 180¬∞C for 10 minutes.",

          "The secret is the double coating technique (buttermilk, flour, buttermilk, flour), letting the coated chicken rest for 10 minutes before frying, and maintaining the correct oil temperature (170¬∞C). Also, adding cornflour to the flour mixture creates extra crispiness.",
