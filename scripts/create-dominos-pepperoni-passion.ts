    introText:
      "Domino's Pepperoni Passion is the ultimate pizza for pepperoni lovers, featuring a generous double helping of spicy pepperoni slices and a luxurious blend of mozzarella and cheddar cheese. What makes this pizza special is the layering technique - pepperoni both under and on top of the cheese creates maximum flavor in every bite, while the cheese blend provides the perfect stretch and tang that Domino's is famous for. The Pepperoni Passion uses Domino's signature hand-tossed dough with their classic tomato sauce, creating a balanced base that lets the star ingredients shine. This copycat recipe replicates the exact taste and texture of the original, from the slightly crispy base to the perfectly browned, curled pepperoni edges. Whether you're craving that iconic Domino's taste or want to impress pizza night guests, this homemade version delivers authentic pizzeria-quality results that rival the takeaway, all from your own kitchen!",

      "If you don't have a pizza stone, use an upturned baking tray. Preheat it thoroughly for at least 30 minutes for best results.",
      "Make the dough ahead: it can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 3 months. Bring to room temperature before shaping.",

        question: "What makes Pepperoni Passion different from a regular pepperoni pizza?",
        answer:
          "The Pepperoni Passion features double the pepperoni of a regular pizza, with pepperoni both under and on top of the cheese. It also uses a specific cheese blend (mozzarella and cheddar) rather than just mozzarella, giving it extra flavor and that signature Domino's taste.",

        question: "Can I use a different type of pepperoni?",
        answer:
          "Yes! While Domino's uses their signature pepperoni blend, any good-quality pepperoni works. For the most authentic taste, use thin-sliced pepperoni that curls when cooked. Spicy pepperoni adds extra kick, while turkey pepperoni is a leaner alternative.",

        answer:
          "Three key steps: 1) Preheat your pizza stone or tray for at least 30 minutes at maximum temperature. 2) Don't overload with sauce - keep it moderate. 3) Bake at the highest temperature your oven allows (240-260¬∞C). The hot stone and high heat create that crispy bottom.",

        question: "Can I make this without a pizza stone?",
        answer:
          "Absolutely! Use a heavy baking tray turned upside down and preheated in the oven. Alternatively, use a regular baking tray (though the base may be slightly less crispy). Some people even use a cast iron skillet with great results!",

          "Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. To reheat, use an oven at 180¬∞C for 10 minutes or a frying pan over medium heat (covered) for 5 minutes - this keeps the base crispy. Avoid microwaving as it makes the base soggy.",
