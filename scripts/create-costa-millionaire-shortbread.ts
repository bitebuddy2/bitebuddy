    introText:
      "Costa's Millionaire Shortbread is one of the most popular treats in their caf√© cabinets, and for good reason - it's a triple-threat dessert featuring buttery, crumbly shortbread, a thick layer of rich, chewy caramel, and a generous blanket of smooth chocolate on top. Also known as Caramel Shortbread or Caramel Slice, this Scottish-invented classic became 'millionaire' shortbread because it's so rich and indulgent it tastes like something a millionaire would eat. Costa's version has earned legendary status among their customers, with many claiming it's the best high street millionaire shortbread available - perfectly balanced between the three layers, never too sweet, and always satisfyingly thick. What makes Costa's millionaire shortbread stand out is the quality of each component: the shortbread base is substantial enough to support the generous toppings without being too hard, the caramel layer is properly thick and chewy (not thin and sticky), and the chocolate topping is a smooth combination of milk and dark chocolate that provides richness without overwhelming sweetness. The secret to recreating it at home lies in getting the proportions right - equal layers of shortbread, caramel, and chocolate - and taking care with the caramel, which requires patient stirring to achieve that perfect fudgy consistency. This recipe uses the same techniques Costa's suppliers use, ensuring you get that iconic texture and taste. Making it yourself means you can enjoy this caf√© favourite at a fraction of the cost, cut it into exactly the portions you prefer, and impress friends and family with your baking skills. While it does require some time (mostly hands-off cooling), the actual preparation is straightforward, and the result is bakery-quality millionaire shortbread that rivals Costa's!",

    tips: [
      "The key to perfect caramel is constant stirring and patience. Don't rush it - undercooked caramel will be too runny, while overcooked will be too hard and can taste burnt.",
      "Use a heavy-bottomed pan for the caramel to prevent scorching and hot spots. Non-stick pans work well but stainless steel gives you a better view of the colour change.",
      "If your caramel looks like it's splitting or becoming grainy, remove from heat and whisk vigorously. Adding a tablespoon of hot water can help bring it back together.",
      "Cold shortbread is easier to work with when spreading the caramel - let it cool completely first.",
      "For perfectly even layers, use the same sized tin specified (20x30cm). A smaller tin will give you thicker layers, a larger one will be thinner.",
      "Make it salted caramel millionaire shortbread by sprinkling sea salt flakes over the chocolate just after spreading, before it sets - absolutely delicious!",
      "The chocolate sets faster in the fridge but can sometimes develop a white 'bloom'. This doesn't affect taste, but for best appearance, set at cool room temperature.",
      "These freeze brilliantly! Wrap individual pieces in parchment and freeze for up to 3 months. Defrost at room temperature for 30 minutes before eating.",

        question: "Why is my caramel too soft/runny?",
        answer:
          "The caramel wasn't cooked long enough. It needs to reach 115¬∞C and coat the back of a spoon thickly. If your caramel is too soft after setting, you can actually return the whole thing to the pan (scrape it off the shortbread base) and cook it for another 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly, then pour it back over the shortbread to set again.",

        question: "Can I use all milk chocolate or all dark chocolate?",
        answer:
          "Yes, but the Costa version uses a mixture for balanced flavour - all milk chocolate can be too sweet, while all dark can be too bitter. If you prefer one or the other, go ahead and use 300g of your chosen chocolate. White chocolate also works beautifully for a different twist!",

        question: "My shortbread is too crumbly/falls apart when I cut it. Why?",
        answer:
          "This usually means the shortbread base wasn't pressed firmly enough into the tin. The mixture should be very well compacted - really press down hard with the back of a spoon. Also, make sure to cut the millionaire shortbread with a very sharp knife using a firm, downward motion rather than a sawing action. Cutting while it's still slightly chilled helps too.",

        question: "Can I make this in advance?",
        answer:
          "Absolutely! Millionaire shortbread keeps brilliantly. Make it up to 1 week ahead and store in an airtight container at room temperature, or up to 2 weeks in the fridge. It's actually easier to cut when it's been chilled, so making it a day ahead is ideal. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.",

        question: "How do I prevent the layers from separating?",
        answer:
          "Make sure each layer is properly set before adding the next one. The shortbread should be completely cool before adding caramel, and the caramel should be completely firm before adding chocolate. Also, don't overheat the chocolate - it should be just melted and still slightly warm, not hot, when you pour it over the caramel.",
