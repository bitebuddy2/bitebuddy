    introText:
      "Nando's Peri Peri Chicken is a global phenomenon that started in South Africa in 1987 and has taken the world by storm with its addictive flame-grilled chicken and legendary peri peri sauce. The secret lies in the Portuguese-African fusion of flavours - the peri peri chilli (also known as African bird's eye chilli) combined with garlic, lemon, and herbs creates an irresistible marinade that's simultaneously spicy, tangy, and aromatic. What makes Nando's chicken truly special is the technique: butterfly-spatchcocked chicken that's marinated for hours, then flame-grilled to perfection with that signature char. The result is incredibly juicy chicken with crispy, caramelized skin and layers of complex flavour in every bite. This homemade version captures the exact taste of Nando's famous Medium or Hot peri peri chicken, using authentic ingredients and traditional Portuguese-African techniques. Whether you grill it outdoors or roast it in the oven, you'll achieve that same restaurant-quality chicken that keeps people queuing at Nando's worldwide!",

The peri peri tradition comes from Portuguese explorers who brought African bird's eye chillies from Mozambique to Portugal in the 15th century, creating this unique Portuguese-African fusion cuisine.",

        answer:
          "Bird's eye chillies (also called piri piri or African bird's eye) are small, fiery red chillies essential for authentic peri peri sauce. Find them in Asian supermarkets, African grocery stores, or online. They're about 2-3cm long and pack serious heat.

        answer:
          "Absolutely! Chicken thighs, drumsticks, or breasts all work brilliantly. Marinate the same way but adjust cooking time: thighs and drumsticks need 30-35 minutes, breasts need 25-30 minutes. Bone-in pieces give the most authentic Nando's taste and stay juicier than boneless.",

        answer:
          "For a mild version (like Nando's Lemon & Herb), use only 2-3 bird's eye chillies (deseeded), skip the cayenne pepper, and add an extra tablespoon of lemon juice. You can also make a separate mild marinade for kids' portions. The sweetness from the red pepper and brown sugar balances the heat nicely.",

        answer:
          "Nando's peri peri is unique because it's not just about heat - it's a balanced blend of chilli, citrus, garlic, and herbs with Portuguese-African origins. The bird's eye chilli provides the heat, lemon adds tang, garlic gives depth, and the paprika and herbs create complexity. It's both a marinade and a sauce, unlike most hot sauces which are just condiments.",
