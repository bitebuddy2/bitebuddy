    introText:
      "Wagamama's Beef and Kimchee Gyoza represent the restaurant's innovative approach to Japanese cooking - taking the traditional gyoza format and infusing it with bold Korean flavours. These dumplings are a fusion masterpiece, combining juicy British beef mince with tangy, spicy kimchi (Korean fermented cabbage), gochugaru (Korean chili flakes), and aromatic ginger and garlic. The result is a gyoza with layers of flavour: umami-rich beef, funky fermented kimchi tang, gentle heat from gochugaru, and the fresh bite of spring onions. What makes these gyoza so special is the contrast between the spicy, bold filling and the delicate wrapper, all crowned with that signature crispy golden bottom that Wagamama is famous for. Kimchi is a cornerstone of Korean cuisine, celebrated for its complex fermented flavours and probiotic benefits, and it brings a unique depth to these dumplings that sets them apart from more traditional fillings. The slight acidity of the kimchi cuts through the richness of the beef, while the gochugaru adds a warm, smoky heat rather than aggressive spice. These gyoza are perfect for spice lovers looking for something more adventurous than standard pork dumplings. They work brilliantly as a sharing starter for 4, or as a satisfying light meal for 2 when paired with steamed rice and more kimchi on the side. The recipe might seem involved, but most of the work is in the folding - and even imperfect gyoza taste incredible! Making them at home means you control the spice level and can make big batches to freeze for whenever you need a quick, restaurant-quality meal.",

Place a wrapper in your palm and add about 1 heaped teaspoon of filling to the centre - resist the temptation to overfill! Dip your finger in water and moisten the entire edge of the wrapper. Fold in half to create a half-moon, then starting from one end, create 5-6 small pleats along the front edge while pressing against the unpleated back edge. The gyoza should sit upright with a flat bottom. Place on a lightly floured tray and cover with a damp tea towel to prevent drying. Repeat until all filling is used (makes about 30 gyoza).",

    tips: [
      "Use well-fermented kimchi for the best flavour - if it's too fresh, it won't have the tangy punch you need.",
      "Really squeeze that kimchi dry! Excess liquid is the #1 reason gyoza burst during cooking.",
      "Can't find gochugaru? Substitute with 1/2 tsp regular chilli flakes or a pinch of cayenne pepper.",
      "For extra heat, add some of the red chilli paste from the kimchi jar directly into the filling.",
      "These freeze beautifully - freeze uncooked on a tray, then bag up. Cook from frozen, adding 2 minutes to steaming time.",
      "If you're sensitive to spice, start with 1/2 tsp gochugaru and adjust up in future batches.",
      "The pleats aren't just decorative - they help seal the gyoza and prevent bursting during cooking.",

        question: "What is gochugaru and where can I buy it?",
        answer:
          "Gochugaru is Korean red chilli flakes made from sun-dried Korean red chillies. It has a unique fruity, slightly smoky flavour and medium heat. You can find it in Asian supermarkets, large Tesco/Sainsbury's stores (in the world foods aisle), or online. If unavailable, substitute with regular chilli flakes, but the flavour won't be quite as authentic.",

        question: "Can I use shop-bought kimchi?",
        answer:
          "Absolutely - and this is what we recommend! Shop-bought kimchi from Korean brands like Kimchi, Mother-in-Law's, or Assi is perfect and already properly fermented. You can find it in most major supermarkets now (usually in the world foods or fresh sections). Avoid making your own for this recipe as it takes weeks to ferment properly.",

        question: "Are these very spicy?",
        answer:
          "They have a gentle-to-medium heat - more warming than fiery. The gochugaru adds a fruity, smoky warmth rather than aggressive heat. If you're spice-sensitive, reduce gochugaru to 1/2 tsp or omit it entirely (you'll still have heat from the kimchi). For spice lovers, increase to 2 tsp or add fresh red chilli to the filling!",

        question: "Can I make these vegetarian?",
        answer:
          "Yes! Replace the beef with 300g firm tofu (pressed and crumbled) or finely chopped mushrooms (squeezed dry after cooking). Add an extra 1 tsp soy sauce for umami depth. You can also use shop-bought vegan gyoza wrappers (check the label as some contain egg). The kimchi is usually vegan but check the ingredients as some brands use fish sauce.",

        _key: randomUUID(),

        question: "How long will leftover cooked gyoza keep?",
        answer:
          "Cooked gyoza will keep in the fridge for up to 2 days in an airtight container, but they'll lose their crispy texture. Reheat in a hot pan with a splash of water and a lid to re-steam them, then uncover to crisp up the bottoms again. Alternatively, pan-fry them in a little oil. They won't be quite as good as fresh but still delicious!",
