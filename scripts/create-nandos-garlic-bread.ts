    introText:
      "Nando's Garlic Bread is one of those sides that turns a good meal into a great one - crispy, golden ciabatta slathered with rich garlic butter infused with their signature peri-peri spice. Whether you're ordering a half chicken or a butterfly burger, adding garlic bread to your Nando's order is practically mandatory for many fans. What sets Nando's garlic bread apart from standard garlic bread is the addition of peri-peri seasoning, which adds a subtle warmth and complexity that complements their famous flame-grilled chicken perfectly. The bread itself is always ciabatta - chosen for its robust texture that becomes crispy on the outside while staying slightly chewy inside, and its airy structure that soaks up all that flavourful butter. Fresh parsley and a squeeze of lemon juice brighten the rich butter, while generous amounts of fresh garlic provide that punchy flavour Nando's is known for. This homemade version captures everything that makes Nando's garlic bread special, using simple ingredients you can easily find. The secret lies in softening the butter properly so it spreads easily, using fresh garlic rather than dried, and getting the peri-peri seasoning balance just right - enough to add warmth without overwhelming the garlic. Making it at home means you can enjoy that Nando's experience any night of the week, customise the spice level to your preference, and save money compared to restaurant prices. It's ready in just 22 minutes from start to finish - perfect alongside grilled meats, pasta dishes, or simply on its own as a satisfying snack!",
