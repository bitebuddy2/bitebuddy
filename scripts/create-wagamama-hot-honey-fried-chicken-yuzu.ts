    introText:
      "Wagamama's Hot Honey Fried Chicken Yuzu is a modern menu sensation that perfectly captures the restaurant's innovative spirit - taking the globally beloved fried chicken format and elevating it with Japanese and contemporary flavours. This dish is a masterclass in balance: ultra-crispy buttermilk-fried chicken pieces meet a sticky, glossy glaze that's simultaneously sweet (honey), spicy (hot sauce), and bright (yuzu citrus). The result is utterly addictive - each bite delivers crunch, heat, sweetness, and that distinctive yuzu tang that sets it apart from standard Nashville hot chicken or Korean fried chicken. Yuzu is a Japanese citrus fruit with a flavour somewhere between lemon, lime, and grapefruit, but more fragrant and complex. It's become increasingly popular in Western cooking for its ability to add brightness without overpowering other flavours. Combined with honey's natural sweetness and hot sauce's kick, the yuzu creates a glaze that's both exciting and sophisticated. What makes this recipe so appealing is the contrast of textures and temperatures: hot, crispy chicken coated in a warm, glossy glaze, finished with cool spring onions and nutty sesame seeds. The chicken thighs stay incredibly juicy inside their crunchy coating, while the glaze clings to every crispy ridge. It's restaurant-quality fried chicken that you can achieve at home with a few simple techniques. Serve it as a showstopping main for 2 with steamed rice and pickles, or cut into smaller pieces as a sharing starter. This is the kind of dish that gets people excited - bold, Instagrammable, and most importantly, absolutely delicious!",

With their signature long communal benches, open kitchens, and 'positive eating + positive living' philosophy, Wagamama revolutionised casual Asian dining in the UK and has since expanded to over 200 locations worldwide.",

Hot honey - the combination of honey with chilli heat - became wildly popular in the mid-2010s, particularly in American cuisine. Wagamama took this trend and gave it a distinctly Japanese twist by adding yuzu, a citrus fruit that's been used in Japanese cooking for centuries. This fusion approach demonstrates the restaurant's philosophy: respect traditional Japanese ingredients and techniques while staying relevant and exciting to contemporary diners.",

        answer:
          "Yuzu juice is available in most large supermarkets (world foods aisle), Japanese or Asian supermarkets, or online from retailers like Japan Centre or Amazon. Look for bottles labelled 'yuzu juice' or 'yuzu citrus juice'. It's also sometimes sold as yuzu concentrate, which should be diluted according to package instructions.

          "Yes, though you won't get quite the same ultra-crispy result. Coat the chicken as directed, place on a wire rack over a baking tray, spray with cooking oil, and bake at 200¬∞C fan for 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden and cooked through (internal temp 75¬∞C). Spray with more oil after flipping. Glaze as directed. It's healthier but not quite as crispy!",

        question: "How spicy is this dish?",
        answer:
          "It has a medium heat level - warming rather than fiery, thanks to the honey balancing the hot sauce. Start with 2 tbsp hot sauce in the glaze and adjust from there. For milder heat, use 1 tbsp hot sauce or swap for a milder chilli sauce. For extra heat, increase to 4 tbsp or add cayenne pepper to the glaze. The yuzu and honey temper the heat nicely.",

        question: "Can I use chicken breast instead of thighs?",
        answer:
          "You can, but thighs are strongly recommended! Thigh meat is more forgiving (harder to overcook), stays juicier, and has better flavour due to higher fat content. If using breast, cut into slightly smaller pieces and watch the cooking time carefully - they'll cook faster and can dry out if overcooked. Marinating overnight becomes even more important.",

        question: "Can I make the glaze ahead of time?",
        answer:
          "Absolutely! Make the hot honey yuzu glaze up to 1 week ahead and store in an airtight jar in the fridge. It will thicken when cold - simply warm gently in a pan or microwave before using. The flavours actually improve after a day or two as they meld together. Just don't pre-glaze the fried chicken until serving or it will lose its crispness.",
