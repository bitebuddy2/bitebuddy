    introText:
      "Wagamama's Beef Brisket Donburi is the ultimate comfort food - a deeply satisfying rice bowl featuring fall-apart tender beef brisket that's been slowly braised in a fragrant Japanese-inspired broth until it melts in your mouth. This dish is all about patience and low, slow cooking that transforms tough brisket into something extraordinarily tender and flavourful. The braising liquid, enriched with soy sauce, mirin, sake, ginger, garlic, and star anise, infuses every strand of beef with complex, aromatic flavour while creating a rich sauce that ties everything together. What makes this donburi so special is the layering of textures and temperatures: piping hot fluffy sushi rice forms the base, topped with meltingly tender beef that's been shredded into strands, then finished with crisp pak choi, silky soft-boiled eggs with jammy yolks, and fresh garnishes of spring onions, red chilli, and toasted sesame seeds. Each spoonful delivers umami-rich beef, creamy egg, crunchy greens, and fluffy rice all in one perfect bite. This recipe recreates Wagamama's version using traditional Japanese braising techniques - the long cooking time is mostly hands-off, and the result is restaurant-quality beef that rivals any high-end donburi. Making it at home means you can enjoy this premium dish at a fraction of restaurant prices, prepare it in advance for easy weeknight dinners, and adjust the aromatics to your taste. It's perfect for meal prep - the brisket actually improves after a day in the fridge as the flavours develop. While it requires time, the actual effort is minimal, and your kitchen will smell incredible as it braises!",

While brisket isn't a traditional Japanese cut (they typically use short rib or beef cheek for slow-cooked dishes), Wagamama recognized that this affordable, flavourful cut responds beautifully to Japanese braising methods. The dish draws inspiration from 'nikujaga' (Japanese beef and potato stew) and the slow-braised beef found in high-end donburi restaurants across Tokyo, but uses ingredients readily available in UK supermarkets.",

The dish has become particularly popular during autumn and winter months when customers crave rich, warming bowls, and it's often cited by fans as one of Wagamama's best-kept secrets - less famous than their ramen but equally delicious to those who discover it.",

    tips: [
      "The longer you braise, the more tender the beef becomes - some prefer 3.5-4 hours for absolute fall-apart texture. It's hard to overcook brisket!",
      "Make this ahead! The brisket can be braised up to 3 days in advance and stored in its liquid in the fridge. The flavours actually improve overnight. Reheat gently before serving.",
      "Save any leftover braising liquid - it's liquid gold! Use it as a base for ramen broth, freeze for future donburi, or reduce it down further for a glaze.",
      "If the braising liquid seems too salty after reducing, add a splash of water or stock to balance it.",
      "You can cook this in a slow cooker: sear the beef first, then transfer everything to the slow cooker and cook on low for 8-10 hours.",
      "For richer flavour, marinate the brisket in the soy-mirin-sake mixture overnight before cooking.",
      "Toast your sesame seeds in a dry pan for 2-3 minutes until golden - it intensifies their nutty flavour enormously.",
      "Add variety with other vegetables: blanched broccoli, steamed bok choy, or pickled vegetables all work beautifully.",

        question: "Can I use a different cut of beef?",
        answer:
          "Yes! Beef short ribs, beef cheeks, or chuck roast all work wonderfully with this method. Short ribs are particularly good (cook for 2.5-3 hours), while beef cheeks are incredibly tender (cook for 3-3.5 hours). Avoid lean cuts like sirloin or rump - they'll become tough rather than tender with long cooking. You need a cut with good fat marbling and connective tissue that breaks down during braising.",

        question: "How do I know when the brisket is done?",
        answer:
          "The beef should be fork-tender - a fork should slide in easily and the meat should pull apart without resistance. If it's still firm or tough, keep cooking for another 30-60 minutes. The internal temperature should reach at least 90-95¬∞C, but tenderness is a better indicator than temperature for braised meat. When in doubt, cook it longer!",

        question: "Can I make this without sake or mirin?",
        answer:
          "Sake and mirin add authentic Japanese flavour, but substitutes work. Replace sake with dry sherry or dry white wine. Replace mirin with 2 tbsp honey or brown sugar dissolved in 100ml water with a splash of rice vinegar. The flavour will be slightly different but still delicious. Some supermarkets sell non-alcoholic mirin if alcohol is a concern.",

        question: "My braising liquid is too thin - how do I thicken it?",
        answer:
          "After straining, simmer it uncovered for 15-20 minutes to reduce and concentrate the flavours - this naturally thickens it. For a glossier sauce, mix 1 tsp cornflour with 1 tbsp cold water and whisk into the simmering liquid. Alternatively, add 1 tbsp butter at the end and whisk - this creates a rich, silky texture. The sauce should coat the back of a spoon but not be thick like gravy.",

        question: "Can I freeze leftover braised brisket?",
        answer:
          "Absolutely! Shred the beef and store it in the braising liquid in airtight containers or freezer bags (this keeps it moist). Freeze for up to 3 months. Defrost in the fridge overnight, then reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave. The texture actually improves after freezing as the flavours penetrate the meat even more. Perfect for meal prep!",
