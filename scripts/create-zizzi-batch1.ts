    introText: "Zizzi's Mediterranean Sea Bass is a celebration of fresh, simple Italian cooking at its best. Delicate sea bass fillets are pan-fried until the skin is golden and crispy, then served with a vibrant Mediterranean sauce bursting with cherry tomatoes, briny capers, and black olives. The white wine and herbs bring everything together in a light, fragrant sauce that enhances rather than overwhelms the delicate fish. This dish captures the essence of Italian coastal cooking - minimal ingredients, maximum flavor. It's elegant enough for a dinner party yet quick enough for a weeknight meal when you want something special.",
