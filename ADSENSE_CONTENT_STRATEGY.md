# AdSense Content Strategy & Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy to address Google AdSense's "Low value content" policy violation and get your site approved.

## What Google AdSense Requires

### Minimum Content Standards
1. **Substantial Unique Content**: Each page should have 500+ words of original, valuable text
2. **Editorial Content**: Sites need articles, guides, and how-tos beyond just recipes
3. **Expert Perspective**: Personal insights, tips, and knowledge that adds value
4. **Good Content-to-Ad Ratio**: Content should dominate the page, not ads
5. **User Value**: Content must genuinely help users solve problems or learn something

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Recipe Content Enhancement (IMMEDIATE)

#### What We Changed
- Updated recipe schema to **require** substantial content in key fields
- Added minimum character/word validations
- Added helpful descriptions to guide content creation

#### Your Action Items
For EACH existing recipe, add/enhance:

1. **Intro Text** (150-250 words minimum)
   - What makes this dish special
   - Why you'll love it
   - Unique tips or insights
   - Context about when/how to serve it

2. **Brand Context** (200-400 words)
   - History of the original restaurant dish
   - What makes your copycat authentic
   - Secret techniques or ingredients
   - Personal experience with the original

3. **Tips & Variations** (5-10 detailed tips)
   - Success tips for best results
   - Common mistakes to avoid
   - Ingredient substitutions
   - Serving suggestions
   - Storage and reheating advice
   - Dietary modifications

4. **FAQs** (5-8 Q&As, 50-100 words each)
   - Can I make this ahead?
   - How do I store leftovers?
   - What can I substitute for [ingredient]?
   - Why did my [X] turn out [Y]?
   - Is this freezer-friendly?
   - Can I make this vegetarian/vegan?
   - How can I make this healthier?
   - What sides go well with this?

**Example FAQ Format:**
```
Q: Can I make this Greggs Sausage Roll pastry ahead of time?

A: Yes! You can prepare the rough puff pastry up to 2 days in advance. Wrap it tightly in cling film and refrigerate. For longer storage, freeze the pastry for up to 3 months. When ready to use, thaw overnight in the fridge. This actually makes the process easier as you can spread the work over multiple days. The rested pastry often results in even better layers and a flakier texture.
```
