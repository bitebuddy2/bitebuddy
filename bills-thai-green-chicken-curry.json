  "tips": [
    "For a richer curry, use full-fat coconut milk rather than light. The creaminess is part of what makes this dish so good",
    "If you can't find Thai basil, regular basil works but won't have quite the same anise-like flavour",
    "Add bamboo shoots, aubergine, or courgette for extra vegetables - just add them with the green beans",
    "The curry tastes even better the next day as the flavours develop, so it's perfect for meal prep",
    "For extra heat, add sliced red chillies or increase the amount of curry paste",
    "Fresh kaffir lime leaves make a huge difference, but dried ones work in a pinch (use half the amount)"
  ],
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I make this curry vegetarian or vegan?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Replace the chicken with tofu, mushrooms, or extra vegetables like aubergine and courgette. Use vegetarian green curry paste (check the label as some contain shrimp paste) and swap fish sauce for soy sauce or tamari. The rest of the recipe stays the same."
    },
    {
      "question": "How spicy is Thai green curry?",
      "answer": "Green curry is typically medium-hot, but the spice level depends on the curry paste brand. Start with 2 tablespoons if you're sensitive to heat and add more to taste. The coconut milk and sugar help balance the heat."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I freeze Thai green curry?",
      "answer": "Yes, this curry freezes brilliantly for up to 3 months. Cool completely, portion into airtight containers, and freeze. Defrost overnight in the fridge and reheat gently on the hob, adding a splash of coconut milk if needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between green, red, and yellow Thai curry?",
      "answer": "The main difference is the type of chillies used in the paste. Green curry uses green chillies and is typically the hottest and most herbaceous. Red curry uses red chillies and is slightly milder with an earthier flavour. Yellow curry is the mildest, containing turmeric for its golden colour."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need special ingredients I can't find in supermarkets?",
      "answer": "Most UK supermarkets now stock Thai curry paste, coconut milk, and fish sauce in their world foods aisle. Kaffir lime leaves can be harder to find but are available in Asian supermarkets or online - they're worth seeking out for authentic flavour, though lime zest can substitute in a pinch."
