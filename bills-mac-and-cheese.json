  "tips": [
    "Use a mix of cheeses for the best flavour – mature cheddar for depth, mozzarella for stretchiness, and Parmesan for a salty kick",
    "Don't overcook the pasta – it will continue cooking in the oven, so aim for al dente",
    "Make the sauce well-seasoned as pasta absorbs a lot of salt. Taste before baking and adjust",
    "For extra indulgence, add crispy bacon pieces or caramelised onions to the cheese sauce",
    "Panko breadcrumbs make an extra-crispy topping compared to regular breadcrumbs",
    "This can be assembled ahead of time and refrigerated for up to 24 hours before baking – just add 5-10 minutes to the cooking time"
  ],
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I make mac & cheese ahead of time?",
      "answer": "Yes! Prepare the entire dish up to the point of baking, cover tightly, and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. When ready to bake, let it sit at room temperature for 20 minutes, then add 5-10 extra minutes to the baking time to ensure it's heated through."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I stop my cheese sauce from going lumpy?",
      "answer": "The key is to add the milk gradually while whisking constantly. Make sure your roux (butter and flour mixture) is smooth before adding any liquid. If you do get lumps, strain the sauce through a fine sieve or blend it with a stick blender."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I freeze mac & cheese?",
      "answer": "Yes, mac & cheese freezes well for up to 3 months. Freeze it before baking in a freezer-safe dish. Defrost overnight in the fridge, then bake as directed, adding 10-15 minutes to ensure it's heated through. The texture may be slightly different but it's still delicious."
    },
    {
      "question": "What can I add to make it more interesting?",
      "answer": "Try mixing in crispy bacon, caramelised onions, roasted cherry tomatoes, or sautéed mushrooms. You can also stir through cooked broccoli or peas for extra veg. For a spicy kick, add a pinch of cayenne pepper or some jalapeños to the cheese sauce."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is my mac & cheese dry?",
      "answer": "This usually happens if the pasta is overcooked initially or if there's not enough sauce. Make sure your cheese sauce is quite loose before mixing with the pasta – it should coat a spoon thickly but still pour. The sauce will thicken as it bakes. If it looks dry before baking, stir in a splash more milk or cream."
