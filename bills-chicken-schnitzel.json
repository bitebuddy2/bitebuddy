  "tips": [
    "For extra crispy schnitzel, use panko breadcrumbs instead of regular breadcrumbs",
    "Make sure your oil is at the right temperature - too cool and the coating will be soggy, too hot and it will burn before the chicken cooks",
    "Let the breaded chicken rest for 5-10 minutes before frying to help the coating adhere better",
    "Serve with chunky chips and a fresh green salad for the full Bill's experience",
    "You can prepare the breaded chicken up to 2 hours in advance and keep covered in the fridge until ready to fry"
  ],
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I use chicken thighs instead of breasts?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can use boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Pound them to an even thickness just like the breasts. They'll be slightly more flavourful and harder to overcook."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know when the schnitzel is cooked through?",
      "answer": "The breadcrumb coating should be golden brown and crispy, and the chicken should feel firm when pressed. Use a meat thermometer to check it's reached 75°C internally, or cut into the thickest part to ensure there's no pink meat remaining."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I bake these instead of frying?",
      "answer": "Yes, place the breaded chicken on a wire rack over a baking tray and spray lightly with oil. Bake at 200°C for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through. It won't be quite as crispy as fried, but it's a healthier alternative."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I serve with chicken schnitzel?",
      "answer": "Bill's typically serves their schnitzel with chunky chips and salad. Other great options include mashed potatoes, buttered vegetables, coleslaw, or German-style potato salad."
