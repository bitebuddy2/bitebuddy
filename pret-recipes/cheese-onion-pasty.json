  "introText": "The Cheese and Onion Pasty from West Cornwall Pasty Co is a vegetarian classic that proves pasties don't need meat to be deeply satisfying. This simple yet flavourful filling combines sharp mature Cheddar cheese with tender potato and sweet caramelised onions, all encased in that signature buttery shortcrust pastry with the traditional Cornish crimp. It's comfort food that celebrates quality ingredients - the cheese melts into the potato creating a rich, creamy filling while the onions add a subtle sweetness. Perfect for vegetarians or anyone who loves the simplicity of cheese and onion, this copycat recipe delivers the same hearty satisfaction as its meat-based counterparts.",

  "tips": [
    "Use a strong mature Cheddar for maximum flavour - the sharper the better.",
    "Don't skip the caramelisation step for the onions - it adds crucial sweetness and depth.",
    "Make sure the potato and onions are completely cool before assembling or the cheese will melt prematurely and make the pastry soggy.",
    "Add a handful of chopped spring onions to the filling for extra onion flavour.",
    "These freeze beautifully - freeze unbaked for up to 3 months and bake from frozen, adding 10-15 minutes."
  ],
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I use a different cheese?",
      "answer": "Yes! Red Leicester, Double Gloucester or a mix of cheeses work well. Avoid very soft cheeses as they can make the filling too wet. A crumbly cheese like Lancashire is particularly good."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do I need to parboil the potato?",
      "answer": "Parboiling ensures the potato cooks through properly during baking. Raw potato would still be hard by the time the pastry is golden. Just don't overcook them or they'll fall apart."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I make this vegan?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Use vegan cheese and butter, and brush with plant milk instead of egg wash. The result is just as delicious."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long will these keep?",
      "answer": "Store in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven at 180°C for 15-20 minutes until hot through. Don't microwave or the pastry will go soggy."
