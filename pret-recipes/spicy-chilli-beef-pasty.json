  "tips": [
    "Adjust the heat by increasing or decreasing the chilli powder - start with 1 tsp if you prefer milder spice.",
    "Make the filling a day ahead for easier assembly and better flavour development.",
    "Add a handful of grated cheese to the filling for extra richness.",
    "For a smokier flavour, use chipotle chilli powder instead of regular chilli powder.",
    "These freeze brilliantly - freeze unbaked for up to 3 months and bake from frozen, adding 10-15 minutes to cooking time."
  ],
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How spicy is this pasty?",
      "answer": "With 2 tsp of chilli powder, it has a moderate heat - noticeable but not overwhelming. Adjust to your preference by using more or less chilli powder."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I make this with turkey mince instead?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Turkey mince works well as a leaner alternative. You may want to add an extra tablespoon of olive oil as turkey is less fatty than beef."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the filling need to be completely dry?",
      "answer": "Excess liquid will make the pastry soggy. The filling should be thick enough to hold its shape when spooned. If it's too wet, cook it for a few more minutes uncovered."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add vegetables to the filling?",
      "answer": "Yes! Sweetcorn, black beans or diced courgette all work well. Just make sure to cook out any excess moisture before assembling."
