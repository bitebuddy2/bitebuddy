  "description": "Master the authentic Traditional Cornish Pasty from West Cornwall Pasty Co with beef skirt, potato, swede and onion in proper shortcrust pastry. The classic crimped pasty recipe perfected at home.",
  "introText": "The Traditional Cornish Pasty is the cornerstone of West Cornwall Pasty Co's menu and the reason this beloved chain exists. Protected by PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) status, a true Cornish pasty must contain specific ingredients in a particular way: beef, potato, swede (rutabaga), onion, salt and pepper, all encased in a crimped shortcrust pastry. This copycat recipe honours that centuries-old tradition, delivering the same satisfying combination of tender beef and vegetables in a golden, buttery pastry case with the iconic Cornish crimp along the side. It's British comfort food at its finest - hearty, wholesome and deeply flavourful.",

  "tips": [
    "Use beef skirt steak if you can find it - it's the traditional cut and becomes wonderfully tender during baking.",
    "Don't pre-cook the filling! Traditional Cornish pasties are filled with raw ingredients which cook in their own steam.",
    "Cut all vegetables to the same size for even cooking.",
    "For homemade pastry: 500g plain flour, 125g cold butter, 125g lard, 1 tsp salt, 150ml cold water. Rub fats into flour until breadcrumb-like, add water to form a dough.",
    "These freeze brilliantly - wrap individually and freeze for up to 3 months. Bake from frozen, adding 15-20 minutes."
  ],
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between beef skirt and other cuts?",
      "answer": "Beef skirt is a traditional cut from the diaphragm muscle. It's flavourful and becomes tender during the long, slow baking. Chuck steak is a good alternative if you can't find skirt."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I really need swede? Can I use just potato?",
      "answer": "Swede is essential for an authentic Cornish pasty - it provides a subtle sweetness and distinct flavour. Using only potato would make it inauthentic, though it would still taste good!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the filling go in raw?",
      "answer": "This is the traditional Cornish method. The raw ingredients steam inside the sealed pastry, creating tender vegetables and meat that's cooked in its own juices. It's what gives Cornish pasties their characteristic flavour."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know when it's cooked through?",
      "answer": "The pastry should be deep golden brown and if you insert a skewer through the steam hole into the centre, it should come out piping hot. The long baking time at lower temperature ensures everything cooks properly."
