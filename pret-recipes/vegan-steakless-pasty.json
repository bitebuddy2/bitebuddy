  "description": "Make West Cornwall Pasty Co's Vegan Steakless Pasty at home with seasoned plant-based mince, potato, swede and onion in dairy-free pastry. 100% vegan, 100% delicious.",
  "introText": "The Vegan Steakless Pasty from West Cornwall Pasty Co proves that plant-based eating doesn't mean compromising on flavour or tradition. This modern twist on the classic Cornish pasty swaps beef for hearty vegan mince while keeping the traditional vegetable trio of potato, swede and onion. The result is a satisfying, protein-packed meal that's kind to animals and the planet without sacrificing that authentic pasty experience. The plant-based mince absorbs all the savoury seasonings and cooks beautifully with the vegetables, while dairy-free pastry provides the same golden, flaky exterior. Perfect for vegans and flexitarians alike, this copycat recipe delivers proper comfort food credentials.",

    "Make sure your shop-bought pastry is vegan - check the label for butter or milk powder.",
    "Marmite adds incredible umami depth - don't skip it! If you don't have it, use extra soy sauce or vegan Worcester sauce.",
    "Some vegan mince brands are better than others. Look for ones with good texture and protein content.",
    "Add a tablespoon of nutritional yeast to the filling for extra savoury flavour.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's the best vegan mince to use?",
      "answer": "Brands like Quorn Vegan Mince, THIS Isn't Mince, or Meatless Farm all work well. Dried soya mince (rehydrated) is a budget-friendly option. Choose based on texture preference and availability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I make my own vegan pastry?",
      "answer": "Yes! Use 500g plain flour, 125g vegan butter, 125g vegetable shortening, 1 tsp salt and 150ml cold water. Make it exactly like regular shortcrust pastry."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Marmite really necessary?",
      "answer": "While not essential, Marmite adds incredible savoury depth that helps replicate the umami flavour of beef. If you can't use it, substitute with extra soy sauce, vegan Worcester sauce, or a beef-style vegan stock cube."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use different vegetables?",
      "answer": "The potato, swede and onion combination is traditional, but you can add carrot, parsnip or turnip. Just keep the total vegetable amount the same and cut everything to uniform size."
