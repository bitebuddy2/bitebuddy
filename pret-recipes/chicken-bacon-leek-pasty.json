  "tips": [
    "Make sure your filling is completely cool before assembling the pasties to prevent soggy bottoms.",
    "Freeze uncooked pasties for up to 3 months. Bake from frozen, adding 10-15 minutes to the cooking time.",
    "For a richer filling, add a tablespoon of wholegrain mustard or a handful of grated mature cheddar.",
    "If the pastry feels too firm to crimp, let it sit at room temperature for 5 minutes to become more pliable."
  ],
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I make these pasties ahead of time?",
      "answer": "Yes! Assemble the pasties up to 24 hours in advance, cover with cling film and refrigerate. Brush with egg wash just before baking. You can also freeze them unbaked for up to 3 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best way to reheat a pasty?",
      "answer": "Reheat in a preheated oven at 180°C for 15-20 minutes until piping hot throughout. Avoid microwaving as this makes the pastry soggy."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use puff pastry instead of shortcrust?",
      "answer": "While traditional Cornish pasties use shortcrust, you can use puff pastry for a lighter, flakier result. Reduce the baking temperature to 190°C to prevent over-browning."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know when the pasty is cooked through?",
      "answer": "The pastry should be deep golden brown and the filling should reach 75°C internally. If you're unsure, insert a skewer into the centre - it should come out piping hot."
