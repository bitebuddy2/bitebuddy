  "description": "Make West Cornwall Pasty Co's vibrant Spicy Chickpea Roll with seasoned chickpeas, spinach, spices and a kick of chilli in flaky puff pastry. A tasty vegan option that's rolled, not crimped.",
  "introText": "The Spicy Chickpea Roll from West Cornwall Pasty Co breaks with pasty tradition in the best way possible. Instead of the classic crimped D-shape, this vegan creation is rolled like a sausage roll, with flaky puff pastry wrapped around a vibrant filling of spiced chickpeas, wilted spinach and aromatic seasonings. The chickpeas provide protein and substance, while cumin, coriander and chilli bring warmth and depth. It's lighter than a traditional pasty but equally satisfying, offering a modern, plant-based take on portable lunch food. This copycat recipe delivers the same crispy, flaky exterior with a flavourful, protein-packed filling that's perfect for vegans and anyone looking for something a bit different from their usual pasty.",

  "tips": [
    "Make sure your puff pastry is vegan - many brands use butter. Jus-Rol's ready-rolled puff pastry is accidentally vegan in the UK.",
    "Don't over-mash the chickpeas - you want a mix of textures with some whole chickpeas remaining.",
    "The filling must be completely dry and cool before assembling or it will make the pastry soggy.",
    "Add a handful of chopped fresh coriander to the filling for extra freshness.",
    "These can be frozen unbaked - freeze on a tray, then wrap individually. Bake from frozen, adding 5-10 minutes.",
    "Adjust the spice level to taste - reduce chilli powder for mild, or add fresh chopped chilli for extra heat."
  ],
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I use dried chickpeas instead of canned?",
      "answer": "Yes! Soak 250g dried chickpeas overnight, then cook until tender (about 1 hour). Canned is more convenient and works perfectly for this recipe."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use frozen spinach?",
      "answer": "Yes, use about 150g frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed very dry. Frozen spinach contains more water so make sure you squeeze out all excess liquid before adding to the mixture."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are these rolled instead of crimped?",
      "answer": "The rolled format is easier to make and eat, plus the puff pastry creates lovely layers when rolled. It's also quicker to assemble than traditional crimped pasties."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I prevent the rolls from unraveling?",
      "answer": "Make sure to brush the edges with plant milk before rolling - this acts as glue. Place the rolls seam-side down on the baking tray so the weight holds them closed."
