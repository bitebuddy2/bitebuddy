  "introText": "The Steak and Tribute Ale Pasty from West Cornwall Pasty Co is their premium offering - a celebration of Cornish ingredients and brewing heritage. This pasty elevates the traditional format with chunks of quality beef slow-cooked in St Austell Brewery's Tribute Ale, creating a rich, pub-style filling that's both sophisticated and deeply comforting.

  "tips": [
    "Make the filling a day ahead - the flavours improve overnight and it makes assembly much easier.",
    "Use a quality braising steak like chuck or blade - cheaper cuts become wonderfully tender with slow cooking.",
    "If the filling seems too wet after cooling, simmer uncovered for a few more minutes to reduce the liquid.",
    "St Austell Tribute Ale is ideal if you can find it, but any good British bitter or pale ale works well.",
    "Don't skip browning the meat - it's crucial for flavour development.",
    "These can be frozen before baking. Freeze on a tray, then wrap individually. Bake from frozen, adding 15 minutes."
  ],
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I use a different beer?",
      "answer": "Yes! Any British bitter, pale ale or amber ale works well. Avoid very dark stouts or IPAs as they can be too bitter. Tribute, London Pride or Timothy Taylor's Landlord are all excellent choices."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the filling need to be completely cool?",
      "answer": "Hot filling will melt the pastry fat and make it difficult to crimp properly. It can also make the bottom soggy. Always cool the filling completely, ideally overnight in the fridge."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I skip the slow-cooking step?",
      "answer": "The slow-cooking is what makes this pasty special - it tenderises the beef and develops deep flavour. If you're short on time, use a pressure cooker (40 minutes) or pre-cooked beef, but the result won't be quite as good."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't drink alcohol?",
      "answer": "Replace the ale with additional beef stock plus a tablespoon of malt vinegar or Worcestershire sauce for depth. The flavour will be different but still delicious."
