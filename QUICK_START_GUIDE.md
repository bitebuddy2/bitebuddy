# Quick Start Guide: Fix AdSense Low Value Content Violation

This guide helps you quickly implement the most critical fixes to get your BiteBuddy site approved for AdSense.

## Immediate Actions (Do This Week)

### Day 1-2: Update Recipe Schema & Start Content Enhancement

#### 1. Deploy Recipe Schema Updates
The recipe schema has been updated to require more substantial content. Deploy these changes:

```bash
# Your recipe schema (src/sanity/schemaTypes/recipe.ts) has been updated with:
# - Required minimum lengths for intro text (150 chars)
# - Required brand context field
# - Required tips (minimum 5)
# - Required FAQs (minimum 5, with 50-char minimum answers)

# After reviewing the changes, deploy to Sanity Studio
npm run dev
# Then visit http://localhost:3000/studio
# Check that the new field descriptions and validations appear
```

#### 2. Pick Your Top 5 Recipes
Choose your 5 most popular or best recipes to enhance first. For each one:

**Enhanced Intro Text Checklist:**
- [ ] 150-250 words (not just 1-2 sentences)
- [ ] Explain what makes this dish special
- [ ] Share why you love it
- [ ] Add a personal tip or insight
- [ ] Mention when/how to serve it

**Example Before (BAD - Too Short):**
> "This Greggs sausage roll recipe tastes just like the original. Perfect for parties!"

**Example After (GOOD - Substantial):**
> "There's something magical about biting into a Greggs sausage roll fresh from the oven—that impossible flakiness, the perfectly seasoned sausage meat, the golden-brown shimmer. This copycat recipe recreates that experience at home, and I'm not exaggerating when I say friends and family can't tell the difference. The secret is in the rough puff pastry technique, which creates those iconic flaky layers without the hours of work traditional puff pastry requires. I've tested this recipe over 20 times to get the meat seasoning perfect—it's all about the ratio of sage to white pepper. Whether you're planning a party, wanting an impressive breakfast treat, or just craving that Greggs taste, this recipe delivers every time. Best served warm from the oven, though they reheat beautifully too."

**Brand Context Checklist:**
- [ ] 200-400 words about the original dish
- [ ] History or background of the restaurant item
- [ ] What makes your copycat authentic
- [ ] Personal experience with the original
- [ ] Techniques that replicate the original

**Tips & Variations Checklist (Add 5-10):**
- [ ] Success tips for best results
- [ ] Common mistakes to avoid
- [ ] Ingredient substitutions
- [ ] Make-ahead instructions
- [ ] Storage and reheating advice
- [ ] Dietary modifications (vegetarian, vegan options)
- [ ] Serving suggestions
- [ ] Pairing ideas

**FAQs Checklist (Add 5-8 with detailed answers):**
Examples of good FAQs:
- "Can I make this ahead?" (50-100 word answer)
- "How do I store leftovers?" (50-100 word answer)
- "What can I substitute for [ingredient]?" (50-100 word answer)
- "Why did my [X] turn out [Y]?" (troubleshooting, 50-100 word answer)
- "Is this freezer-friendly?" (50-100 word answer)
- "Can I make this vegetarian/vegan?" (50-100 word answer)

## Content Creation Tips for Speed

### Batch Your Work

**Batch Recipe Updates:**
- Set aside 2-3 hours
- Update 10 recipes in one sitting
- Use template language and personalize
- It gets faster with practice

**Batch Article Writing:**
- Dedicate one morning/afternoon to writing
- Use the template as your outline
- Write 2 articles in one session
- Edit and add images later

### Use Your Voice

Don't try to sound like a professional food writer. Write like you're explaining to a friend:
- "I've made this 20 times and here's what I learned..."
- "The secret is..."
- "Don't make my mistake of..."
- "This tastes just like the original when you..."

### Draw from Experience

Your best content comes from real experience:
- Share your trial and error
- Mention family feedback
- Describe the taste, smell, texture
- Compare to the original restaurant version

### Don't Overthink

Perfect is the enemy of done. Aim for:
- Helpful and informative
- Detailed and specific
- Personal and authentic
- Clear and well-structured

You can always edit and improve later. Getting content published is the priority.

## Need Help?

### Common Questions

**Q: This seems like a lot of work. Is it really necessary?**
A: Google AdSense requires substantial, unique content. Sites with thin content are consistently rejected. The work you put in now pays dividends in long-term ad revenue and SEO improvements.

**Q: Can I use AI to help write content?**
A: AI can help with outlines and structure, but Google specifically warns against low-quality AI content. Always heavily edit, add personal experience, and ensure it sounds like a human expert wrote it. The example articles provided are the quality standard.

**Q: How long until I get approved?**
A: After making these changes, wait 1 week for Google to recrawl, then reapply. Approval can take 1-2 weeks after reapplication. Total timeline: 3-4 weeks from starting these changes.

**Q: What if I don't have time to do all of this?**
A: Prioritize in this order:
1. Enhance your top 10 recipes first (the ones getting most traffic)
2. Publish the 3 provided example articles
3. Create 5 more original articles
4. Gradually enhance remaining recipes

Even partial implementation will improve your chances significantly.
