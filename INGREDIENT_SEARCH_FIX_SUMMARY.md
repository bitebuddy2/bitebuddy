# Ingredient Search Functionality Fix

## Problem Summary
The user searched for "sausage meat, egg, thyme" but got no results, even though recipes with these ingredients existed in the database. The issue was with the hardcoded partial matching in the GROQ query.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Hardcoded Patterns**: The original query only checked for hardcoded patterns like `*sausage*`, `*egg*`, `*thyme*`, `*meat*`
2. **Missing Pattern**: "sausage meat" was not in the hardcoded list, so it never matched
3. **Not Scalable**: Adding new ingredients required code changes

## Solution Implemented

### 1. New Dynamic GROQ Query
Replaced the hardcoded pattern matching with a dynamic approach:

```groq
// Old hardcoded approach
ingredientText match "*sausage*" && "sausage" in $names
|| ingredientText match "*egg*" && "egg" in $names
|| ingredientText match "*thyme*" && "thyme" in $names

// New dynamic approach
lower(ingredientText) in $namesLower ||
lower(ingredientText) match $searchPattern
```

### 2. Updated Parameters
The search now accepts:
- `names`: Array of search terms as entered by user
- `namesLower`: Lowercase version for case-insensitive matching
- `searchPattern`: Dynamic regex pattern like `*(sausage meat|egg|thyme)*`

### 3. Enhanced Matching
The new implementation provides:
- **Exact matching**: Case-insensitive exact ingredient name matches
- **Partial matching**: "sausage" matches "sausage meat", "meat" matches "sausage meat"
- **Multi-term search**: Finds recipes with ANY of the search terms
- **Match scoring**: Recipes with more matching ingredients appear first

## Files Modified

### `/src/sanity/queries.ts`
- Completely rewrote `recipesByIngredientNamesQuery` with dynamic matching
- Removed hardcoded ingredient patterns
- Added proper case-insensitive and partial matching logic

### `/src/app/search/page.tsx`
- Updated to pass `namesLower` and `searchPattern` parameters
- No other changes needed to the UI logic

## Test Results

### Before Fix
```
Search: "sausage meat, egg, thyme" → 0 results ❌
Search: "sausage meat" → 0 results ❌
Search: "SAUSAGE MEAT" → 0 results ❌
```

### After Fix
```
Search: "sausage meat, egg, thyme" → 1 result with 3 matches ✅
Search: "sausage meat" → 1 result ✅
Search: "SAUSAGE MEAT" → 1 result ✅
Search: "sausage" → 1 result (matches "sausage meat") ✅
Search: "meat" → 1 result (matches "sausage meat") ✅
Search: "egg, thyme" → 1 result with 2 matches ✅
```

## Debug Scripts Created

Several debug scripts were created to help investigate and verify the fix:

1. **`scripts/debug-ingredients-search.ts`** - Analyzes ingredients in database
2. **`scripts/test-current-search.ts`** - Tests the original broken query
3. **`scripts/test-new-search.ts`** - Tests the improved query
4. **`scripts/test-web-interface.ts`** - Simulates web interface behavior
5. **`scripts/final-verification.ts`** - Comprehensive verification tests

## Benefits of New Implementation

1. **Scalable**: No hardcoded patterns - works with any ingredient
2. **Flexible**: Supports partial matching in both directions
3. **Case Insensitive**: Works regardless of capitalization
4. **User Friendly**: More intuitive search behavior
5. **Maintainable**: No code changes needed for new ingredients
6. **Performance**: Uses efficient GROQ filtering and scoring

## Migration Notes

This change is backward compatible. Existing search URLs will continue to work. The search behavior is improved for all users without any breaking changes.

The search now properly handles:
- Single ingredients: "chicken"
- Multiple ingredients: "chicken, rice, herbs"
- Partial matches: "sausa" → "sausage meat"
- Case variations: "CHICKEN" → "chicken"
- Mixed formats: "Egg, MILK, thyme"

## Testing Commands

To test the search functionality:

```bash
# Test with environment variables loaded
cd /path/to/bitebuddy
source .env.local
npx tsx scripts/final-verification.ts
```

The ingredient search functionality is now working as expected and should provide much better results for users.
